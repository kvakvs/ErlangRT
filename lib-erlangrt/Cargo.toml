# Add "trace_opcode_execution" to print every opcode
# Add "trace_register_changes" to print every register change as we go
# Add "fancy_string_quotes" to use unicode ‹quotes› for strings and disable
#    backslash \quoting of "quotation" characters. This breaks compatibility of printed
#    Erlang terms and the compiler won't accept them back but is beneficial for
#    reading strings with quotes such as JSON.
# Add "trace_comparisons" to log failed comparisons with args involved
# Add "trace_calls" to see native and BEAM function calls logged
# Add "trace_beam_loader" to print code loading debugging info
